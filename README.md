# Telegram_Games

In these codes, I implemented some internal telgram games which were released in 2016 telegram update. 
I wrote all the codes for these games in 2016.

For runnig these programs you need to install pyautogui library first, then run the codes. Other libraries and packages are all python packages which are installed by deafult if you have installed your python by downloading Anaconda. Modules used in these programs are also built-in python modules.
